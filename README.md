# Batch_Scripts
A collection of handy scripts-pressets for video convertations with help of FFMPEG

__!!!REQUIRES TO HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMS IN YOUR `PATH` ENV VARIABLE THAT ARE RELATED TO EACH BATCH!!!__
I belive you can google on how to edit environment variables in your OS.

### Stuff that requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/):
  * `dl.bat`

### Stuff that requires [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/):
  * `cav.bat`
  * `cnvrt.bat`
  * `gif.bat`

### `.py` Files require [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Multi dependencies:
  * `Python/converter` - [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

> __Pro tip__: you can add the folder with scripts into your PATH env variable as well, so you will be able to access it from console or File Explorer's path execution feature, or whatever it's called:
